It requires focus: Focus on the thing you are writing about. Focus on the words you are writing. It immerses you in a topic by forcing you to think about it, interpret it and put it into words at the same time. To me, it is one of the few occassions in life where my mind turns quiet. Background noise is cancelled out, the wandering of the mind stops and my whole self commits to the task. Focus, especially at this level, is a serious high state to exist in.</p><p>To attain focus, for me, there are, essentially, three requirements. First, I need to immensely enjoy the activity itself. Activities that are currently in my focus-worthy arsenal include analyzing, climbing, cooking, designing, mountaineering, reading, structuring, coding and writing. Once I get to dive into any of these things, by which I mean that I get to give them at least 15 – 20 minutes of concentrated attention, I get sucked into a zone, a flow – a state of abundant potential and creativity, productivity and joy.</p><p>Second, I need to be challenged at a level that demands my undivided attention. Benign tasks will not ignite my passion and focus. If it is too easy, too shallow, too straightforward, I do not feel like my effort is invested very well. There is no focus as long as the mind is wandering, which it usually starts for one of three reasons: By interruption, which per defnition directs your attention away from what you are currently doing, and which you need to avoid like the devil if you want to attain flow. Due to untapped brainpower, because your brain never rests. Which means that if you can solve the task with, say, half of your mental capacity, the other half will indulge in different endeavors to keep itself, and ultimately you, busy. And, finally, through a lack of concentration, which usually is a sign that you are lacking a critical physical resource such as sleep, food, water or motion. Which happens quite frequently – once you reach a highly immersive flow state, you will catch yourself not eating, not drinking, sometimes not even moving for hours that are just flying by.</p><p>And third, there needs to be some permanent gain in it. Something to learn. Something to create, to grasp. A new insight, new possibilities or any lasting improvement, be it physical, mental or intellectual. Reciting the list of my focus activities, this would translate to new perspectives and insights through analyzing something, improved power, motion engrams and physique by climbing, a delicious meal after cooking, new, improved and beautiful solutions from desigining, new mental strength and clarity, a heightened sense of awareness and a more profound appreciation for existence itself through mountaineering, knowledge, understanding and inspiration from reading, a clearer picture and deeper understanding of something by analyzing, improved effectiveness and performance through structuring, new learnings, better tools for more productivity and ease-of-life by coding and, to come full circle, getting to better know myself and getting a better idea of how I see, and feel about, things, how I function and what drives me, and, basically, who I am, through writing.</p><picture>

To write, to me, is to express myself while reflecting on myself, and vice versa. It is to look at myself, at the world, at anything really, and then to rotate that thing and revolve around it, to tinker and play with it, and to explore it deeply through experimenting on what it might turn into, when putting into it different meanings, by putting it into various words. To write is to get to know something by describing it, to find out what something is by finding the words to convey it.</p><p>The written word is, in so many ways, more profound than a thought. By manifesting something intangible it immediately becomes more real.

It is the container that allows us to take hold of it, to pass it on, to store it, to exchange and to preserve it. Writing is to thoughts like water is to a tree. It allows us to nurture a seed, to grow something bigger from something small, to shape the landscape of our mind and, ultimately, our world. Writing is to thoughts like heat is to wood. It sparks a flame, enlightens the dark and turns potential into energy, making use of something useful. Writing is to thoughts like water is to fire. It controls the blaze, isolates it and can prevent it from spreading, or even end its very existence.</p><p>Writing is a powerful tool of transformation. By looking at something through the eyes of tragic, sincerity, passion, thoughtfulness or humor, and putting into words our perspective, we tap into the power of transforming other peoples’ emotions towards, opinions about, and state on pretty much anything.</p><p>This power I desire. To take Threatening, Sad, Tragic, Upsetting and Intimidating and turn them into Absurd, Ironic, Hilarious and Comical. To tackle trouble and take seemingly heavy burdens off of peoples shoulders by lightening their image through ridicule . Because your worst enemy will loose his negative influence over you once you can turn him into a source of laughter. A smile on your face can change how everyone you meet that day will feel, and however bad anything may seem, laughter and giggling will disrupt any looming negativity and dissolve once menacing problems and dreadful expectations. You cannot be sad with a smile on your face.</p><p>The power of humor is to shift peoples perception, to turn their focus on the light side of things, to disempower negativity and to ignite the notion that feeling good is not a matter of circumstances, but in fact a matter of how to interpret the world around oneself. It is a wonderful vehicle to empower people, to make them happy, to bring joy to their lifes and to maybe enlighten them, all through the miraculous medium of laughter.</p><picture>
